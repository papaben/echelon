Echelon
--------

A straightforward database schema management toolkit.

It can be used as standalone system for any application stack or integrated into a PHP application.

Overview
--------

Database schema management is a critical part of the continuous application deployment life cycle. Echelon's purpose is to make the process as straightforward as possible so that developers can focus on the schema migrations themselves and not worry about the process.

Database schema migrations, henceforth referred to as "migrations", are discrete changes to the schema (DDL) of a database. Migrations have a forward and a backward application. As a best practice, forward migrations should be backwards compatible.
